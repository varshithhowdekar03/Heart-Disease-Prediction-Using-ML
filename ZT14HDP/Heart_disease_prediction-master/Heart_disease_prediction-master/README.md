[Final code](https://github.com/chayandatta/Heart_disease_prediction/blob/master/heart_Disease.ipynb)

```
Heart Disease prediction using 5 algorithms

- Logistic regression,
- Random forest,
- Naive Bayes,
- KNN(K Nearest Neighbors),
- Decision Tree

then improved accuracy by adjusting different aspect of algorithms.

> Data Set Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to 
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
